The ElvesWay is an approach to provide assistance for efficient programming of
ADuCMxx devices with the main targets of:
<UL>
	<LI>code efficiency
	<LI>execution speed 
	<LI>ease of programming development.<P>
</UL>

Elves are different from Wizards.  Wizards help a programmer by doing magic 
that the user need not (and mostly does not) understand.  In contrast Elves 
help the user to write good code and at the same time Elves help the user 
understand exactly what the code will be executing.<P>

To achieve its goal the ElvesWay provides efficient sets of low level functions 
for the peripherals.  The application Elves.exe version 3 can then be used by 
the programmer to easily choose the required functions and parameters to use in 
the end application.  This addition of Elves is the secret that allows for 
efficient function implementations without sacrificing ease of use.<P>

Although useful to get a quick start and to configure peripherals, the 
ElvesWay is targeted to be used throughout the software development cycle.<P>

The functions provide features suitable for the software programmer without 
loosing sight of the features of the underlying hardware.<P>

The ElvesWay is easy to implement so that programmers can easily add their 
own sets of functions that integrate seamlessly into the system. <P>

Elves can be run as a standalone program or integrated into an IDE such as EWARM 
from IAR or uVision from Keil.<P>
