When Elves starts it opens with its main window as shown:<P>

<img SRC="AEO.png" BORDER=0><P>

When Elves first opens it also opens <B>Notepad</B> with a text file giving
brief instructions. This is mainly to set up the normal help system. See 
<A href="AES_B.html">Setup</A> to switch help modes.<P>

The control elements of the Elves window are described below.<P>

<H3><A href="AES_B.html">Setup</A></H3>

This button opens the setup window which is described in the 
<A href="AES_B.html">Setup</A> section.<P>

<H3>F1 = Help</H3>

This opens help according to the help mode selected in 
<A href="AES_B.html">Setup</A>. For general guidelines on how to use help go to 
the <A href="../AO_B.html">General Overview</A> page.<P>

<H3>Select Library</H3>

This set of controls enables the user to select which library source files to 
work with. This is done using the <B>Add</B> button to select the appropriate
header files. Such selected files are listed in the list box. To 
remove an entry in the list, first select it and then press the <B>Unlist</B> 
button. To change the selection, simply drop down the list and select the 
required header file. When the choice is changed the relevant details are
changed on the rest of the screen to suit.<P>

The contents of the list box can be copied and pasted to the user source file
for the #include list. e.g.<BR>
#include "C:\M360\IAR\Jobs\Libs\Dio\DioLib.h".<P>

To work with Elves the libraries have to follow certain rules as described in 
<A href="AEC_B.html">Elves Code Rules</A>.<P>

Initially the Source Code window will show the main contents of the chosen 
header file.  Subsequently clicking the <B>Show</B> button will reload the header 
file contents to the Source Code window.


<H3>Choose Function</H3>

This list automatically lists the functions contained in the chosen library.
Drop down the list and select the required function. When a function is chosen
its source code is automatically copied from the library source file to the 
Source Code edit box.<P>

<H3>Source Code</H3>

This edit box is a direct copy from the function's source code. This consists
of the header which gives exact instruction how to use the function and 
what it does. Also shown is the actual source code which the user can 
view and thus determine exactly what the function does.

<H3>Choose Parameters.</H3>

For use in C programs the user can choose the parameters of the functions 
using the Edit Boxes, Combo Boxes and List boxes as applicable. The resulting 
complete function can then be placed into the users code as described below.
When deciding what to select for the parameters the user can make use of the 
information in the Source Code window.  Clicking on the parameter name
will scroll the parameter details into view in the Source Code window.

<H3>Copy</H3>

This button places the function name plus the selected parameters onto the
clipboard. For the example shown the clipboard contents would be 
<PRE>DioCon(DIO_GP0,0x9000)</PRE>
At this stage the user can paste this code into his own source editor.<P>

<H3>Helpers</H3>

Helpers are additional applications that can be accessed through the Elves 
application.  Helper applications must reside in the same folder as the 
function source code (in the example DioMpx.exe is in 
C:\M360\IAR\Jobs\Libs\Dio\).<P>


<H3>Exit</H3>

This button closes the application.<P>
